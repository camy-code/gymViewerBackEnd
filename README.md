## Back end
Hello,

The following  code is my backend for my improved open gym scheduler viewer.
The code uses flask to handle the requests and then beautiful soup to handle the 
parsing. Requests is used to well... make the requests! 

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all the needed requirements. 

```pip freeze > requirements.txt``` to freeze your current requirements if you add to the repo.

This is my backend repo and so please click on my front end repo to read more on the project

There is also a youtube video link if one wishes to view the functionality through a
